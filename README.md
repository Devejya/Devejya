**I'm interested in all parts of Data Science (ML SWE, ML Infra, ETL, Modelling, Analysis, Deployment, etc.) along with a whole lot of other things, in summary I'm currently a Data Science generalist looking to explore! Currently, I'm diving deeper into Data Eng at @SnapTravel**

- 🔭 I’m currently working on learning more about **Word Embeddings** and tweaking existing approaches!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Word Embedding approaches (Word2Vec, GloVe, SVD based, BERT) and a lot of Physics (Quantum Mech, Stat Mech, etc.)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on some **NLP** projects (Identify Fake Job Postings, Lyric Generator, etc.)
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with starting a consulting business to help small businesses (Resteraunts, Convenience stores, etc.) transform during these tough times!
